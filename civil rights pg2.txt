<h1>Black Lives Matter- A Timeline</h1>

<div>Since the death of Trayvon Martin, the world has started clearly 
seeing an issue that has been going on in America since the founding of this country. 
Over the last 8 years, we have seen a call for change that has lit a fire in the 
minds and hearts of millions of people. </div>
<div>A note: The following timeline does not begin to touch the number of victims robbed of their lives by police in the US.</div> 
<ul>
  <li>2012: The murder of Trayvon Martin.</li>
  <li>2013: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi created Black Lives Matter.</li> 
  <li>2014: The murder of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, John Crawford III, and Tamir Rice.</li>
  <li>2015: The murder of Anthony Hill, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, and Sandra Bland.</li>
  <li>2016: The murder of Deborah Danner, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, and Korryn Gaines. Colin Kaepernick takes a knee during the National Anthem
