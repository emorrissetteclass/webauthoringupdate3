<p><div>My grandfather, now a great grandfather himself, protested in 1971. 
For 50 years, he has seen the dissent happening worldwide and offers a unique perspective on
protests happening currently, especially in regards to police brutality and racism. While things have
changed on a large scale, the main problem still exists- brutality towards people of color, especially
at the hands of law enforcement.</div></p>

<p><div>The protests of 2020 have modernized the civil rights movement by not only fighting for the rights 
of people of color, but also for the rights of LGBT individuals. The protests since the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin have remained 
largely peaceful, but it seems that a sense of devision runs deep nearly 12 years later and the demonstrations have gained momentum all over the world. In fact, the 
racial unrest in 2020 has gathered over 15 million people.</p></div>

<p><div>In the face of one of the greatest revolutions for equal human rights, we have a choice to make. What kind of world do we want for our children and 
grandchildren? Do we want one where we are held back by primitive idea of a racial supremacy? Or do we want a world where we can all work together to 
learn and grow together as human kind?</p></div>
